**What I learnt**  
1. The importance of patience when coding.  
2. How to incorporate the `readline` and `lowdb` modules in typescript and javascript  
3. Error management and importance of testing
4. Planning in relation to dealing with projects
5. File handling and using files for data persistence
6. Deeper understanding of data types and data structures
  
**Struggles**
